# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction Model

An interactive web app built with Streamlit that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on medical input data.

## 🔍 Overview

This project uses a machine learning model trained on health-related features to predict whether an individual is at risk of heart disease. The interface is powered by Streamlit, making it simple and user-friendly.

## 📊 Features

- Intuitive UI for entering medical data (age, cholesterol, etc.)
- Trained on the UCI Heart Disease dataset
- Instant prediction using a trained ML model
- Streamlit-based web app for rapid deployment and interaction

## 🚀 Tech Stack

| UI / Frontend  | Backend        | ML / Data Science | Deployment |
|----------------|----------------|-------------------|------------|
| Streamlit      | Python         | Pandas, Scikit-learn | Streamlit Cloud / Local |

## 📁 Project Structure


## 🧠 How It Works

1. User enters medical details in the app (e.g., age, cholesterol, resting BP).
2. Inputs are passed to the trained ML model.
3. The model predicts the likelihood of heart disease.
4. The result is displayed instantly.

## 🗂 Dataset

The model is trained using the [UCI Heart Disease dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease).

## ▶️ Running the App Locally

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git
    cd heart-disease-prediction
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the app**
    ```bash
    streamlit run heart_app.py
    ```

4. **Open in browser**
    Visit `http://localhost:8501` automatically or copy-paste it into your browser.

## 🌐 Deploy Online

Deploy easily using [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) by pushing your code to GitHub and connecting your repository.

## ✨ Future Work

- Model comparisons with advanced algorithms
- Add visualizations and charts for input stats
- Store user input and prediction history
- Integrate feedback or risk recommendations
